# Node.js-REST_API
Backend API that interacts with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) API by retrieving vehicle information and relaying the vehicle information to a consumer of your API.

Unit testing for each route is done using Mocha and Chai.

Some screenshots are attached that shows the results.

I would suggest to use the JSON viewer plugin for chrome, where the response is cleaner.

## Instructions to run
1) Clone the repository locally.
2) Open the folder in a code editor.
3) Open the terminal and type 'npm install' to install all the dependencies.
4) Run the application with 'npm start'.
5) The server will start on Port 5000, where you can test all the routes.
6) Type 'npm test' to run the test cases.
